# Exploring-Why-Civil-Resistance-Works

This repository will serve as a place where the project from the course **Applied Machine Learning** will be uploaded. The course is part of the curriculum of the Department of Management Science and Technology from the Athens University of Economics and Business and the project is assigned by [Panos Louridas](https://github.com/louridas).

## Dataset

The data that we will be using can be found here: [Why Civil Resistance Works (WCRW)](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Data-and-Replication-Files-3.zip).
